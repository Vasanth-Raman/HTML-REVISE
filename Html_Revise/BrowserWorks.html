<h1>What is Browser?</h1>

<p>
    A web browser is a software that enables users to access and view content on the World Wide Web. 
    Its primary function is to locate and retrieve web pages, images, videos, documents, and other files
     from servers and display them on the user’s device.

    For instance, imagine you want to visit a website. Here’s where the browser comes in. When you type 
    the website’s URL into the browser’s address bar and hit Enter, your browser sends a request to the 
    server where the website’s files are stored. This communication happens over protocols such as HTTPS
     (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) or HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).
    
    On receiving your request, the server sends back the website’s files. These files are often written in
     languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Your browser’s job is to interpret this code and render it 
     into the web page you see.
    
    In essence, the browser acts as a bridge between you and the website, sending your requests to the server 
    and translating the server’s response into a format you can easily interact with on your device. Without a 
    browser, navigating the vast ocean of internet content would be nearly impossible.

<h1>Web Page Rendering:</h1>

<p>
     When you visit a website, the browser retrieves the website’s HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
     files from the server. It then interprets and processes this code to construct the web page you see on your
      device. The HTML defines the structure and content of the page, CSS styles the page’s appearance, and 
      JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic elements.

<h1>Components of a Browser</h1>

<p>
    A browser has two elements: front-end and back-end. The complex back end facilitates the core functioning of 
    the browser, and the front end interacts with the user. Let’s dive a bit deeper:
 </p>

 <p>
    Front-end: The front-end of a browser refers to the user-facing part that you interact with. It includes the 
    graphical user interface (GUI) elements, such as the address bar, navigation buttons, bookmarks, and tabs.
    The front-end also handles the rendering of web pages, displaying the content, images, and interactive elements
    on your device’s screen.
 </p>

 <p>
    Back-end: The back-end of a browser encompasses the complex processes that occur behind the scenes. It handles 
    the communication between the browser and web servers, fetching and managing web page resources, and processing 
    the code that makes up the web pages. The back-end interprets HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, ensuring that web 
    pages are rendered correctly. It manages network connections, supports various protocols like HTTP and HTTPS, and 
    handles security measures such as encryption and certificate verification..

<h1>How does a Browser Work? </h1>

<p>
    The process begins with Domain Name System (DNS) resolution, where the browser translates the domain name into an IP
     address to locate the server where the web page is stored.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        The browser then sends an HTTP request to the server, specifying the path and parameters of the requested resource.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Once the server receives the request, it sends an HTTP response to the browser containing the requested resource in
         HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. 
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        The browser's rendering engine interprets and renders the code to display the web page on the user’s device. 
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        The CSS stylesheets are applied to format the web page’s content, including fonts, colors, and layout.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        The browser may also execute JavaScript code on the web page to add interactivity and dynamic behavior. 
    </li>
</ul>
