<!--let's look into forms tags. 
Okay, now what is form tags. Cool at last practice we've seen about input tags.
In that input tags we will be inputting several inormation in fields right, But why we are doing that.
beacuse in order to submit it for certain purpose. TO SUBMIT , here is where forms comes into the picture.-->



<!--what we are gonna do is, we can write bunch of input tags but make sure 
to wrap all the input tags in form tags thats it. As simple as that.
Make sure to add submit type of input or button inside the form tags.
That is the main reason we are adding the input tags in the forms.

whats happening is when u clicks submit button, it sends info to backend over network-->
